# linear_vs_polynomial_regression
## What the linear_vs_polynomial_regression project is for
The linear_vs_polynomial_regression project was created using Python. This project enables the user to do the following:
* Apply Supervised Machine Learning models to a data set
* Observe the difference in the results plotted when applying Linear Regression versus Polynomial Regression on a data set
* Observe the similarities in the results plotted when applying the sklearn inbuilt functions versus the self defined functions for Linear Regression on a data set
* Observe the similarities in the results plotted when applying the sklearn inbuilt functions versus the self defined functions for Polynomial Regression on a data set

The goal of this project was to compare Linear and Polynomial Regression when applied to the same data set using the Python programming language. This project can be used by any person interested in Supervised Machine Learning.

## Instructions for how to test the code
* Download the poly.py file
* Download the Figure_1.png file
* Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your computer
* Open the poly.py file using your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of choice such as Python Idle, Phycharm, Anaconda etc.
* Run the code
